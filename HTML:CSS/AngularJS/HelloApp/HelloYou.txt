Quick Description: 

Using Angular JS, take input from the user and display "Hello" + whatever the user types.


Detailed Description:
1) Use <html ng-app> to start your HTML page, which starts the Angular JS process.
2) Include Angular JS in the <head>.
3) Within the body, create an input area that asks the user to enter their name.
4) Tell Angular JS to set up data binding by using ng-model="yourName" on the input area.
5) Print "Hello" + {{ yourName }} !
