Problem: NumberGuessing
Language: Java

Quick Description: 

Number guessing game where the program picks a random number between 0 and 100. The user must guess the number in 10 tries or less.


Detailed Description:
1) Have the program generate a random number between 0 and 100 (Hint: Use Java's Random method)
2) The user is only allowed to make 10 guesses, so the program should only run while the amount of guesses is between 0 and 10.
3) Prompt the user to make a guess and read the input from the user.
4) (Optional) Check to see if their guess is within the range of 0 to 100. If not, ask them to enter a number in the correct range. (This is optional, but since the program will only generate a number between 0 and 100, this alerts the user if they are entering a number outside of that range.)
5) Check to see if they guessed correctly. If so, print out a congratulatory message and exit the program.
6) If they did not guess correctly, check to see if their guess is lower than the correct number. If so, print a message telling them their guess is too low and to try again.
7) Do the same as step 6, but check if the guess is higher than the correct number.
8) Make sure to exit the program and tell the user if they have guessed too many times.
