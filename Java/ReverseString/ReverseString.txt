Problem: Reverse a String
Language: Java
Difficulty: Medium

Quick Description: 

Ask the user for a string. Now, reverse it!


Detailed Description:
1) Ask the user to enter a String (any length).
2) Store that String in a variable.
3) Now, we want to take that String and print it in reverse.
	Ex. If the user enters "Strings are the coolest", the program will print "tselooc eht era sgnirtS"
4) There are a variety of ways to do this. (Hint: I used Java's built-in StringBuffer method. Check out some of the resources I linked to in the main ReadMe for more information on this method.)
5) Print the reversed String.

- The objective of this problem is to use your googling skills and find an easy way to do this!
