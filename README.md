# starter-code

Code examples and programming problems that anyone can use to practice and improve their skills.

Problems and examples will be in various languages (though mainly Java). They will include super detailed descriptions and comments to help beginner-intermediate level programmers improve their skills and practice programming!

With each problem, I will include a text file with a detailed description of the problem. The description will include step-by-step instructions, aimed at new or beginner programmers to gain a better understanding of creating a complete solution. I'll also include a more basic description for more intermediate programmers to come up with a solution themselves. Some problems may have multiple solutions, and are not guaranteed to be the most efficient (moreso to be explanatory and detailed).

If you see anything that is incorrect (we all make mistakes!) please contact me! Also, anyone is welcome to submit problems in any programming language.
